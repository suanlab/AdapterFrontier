# Adapter Populations

Empirical study of PEFT adapters as **populations** rather than isolated checkpoints. Uses a 50-node RTX 3060 cluster to train large adapter pools and characterize how **diversity, selection pressure, and combination rules** affect downstream performance.

## Reproduction Paths

This repository supports **JSON-level reproducibility** (every headline number re-derivable from the released JSONs, no GPU). Byte-level training replay is deferred — see "Scope of reproducibility" below.

### A. Verify all headline numbers (recommended, <30 seconds, no GPU)

```bash
pip install -r requirements-verify.txt       # numpy/scipy/sklearn/matplotlib/pytest
python3 scripts/reproduce_paper_numbers.py   # 145 assertions, all PASS
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q                  # 17 tests
```

`requirements.txt` is the full training and serving stack (torch, vLLM,
transformers, peft) and is needed only for path C. The verification script
itself is pure standard library.

The bibliography is generated, not typed: `paper/custom.bib` is rebuilt from
the ACL Anthology, the arXiv API and Crossref by

```bash
python3 scripts/build_bibliography.py --check   # fails if the .bib drifted
python3 scripts/check_bibliography.py --online  # resolves all 53 identifiers
```

This re-derives every headline number in the paper from the released JSONs:
corpus counts, BH-FDR cutoff (post-FDR 29.5% SUPPORTED / 16.9% REVERSED),
the corpus-wide frontier R² (48 pools, encoder+decoder, LOPO-CV = +0.597;
encoder-only +0.616), H(c|conf) decoder gap (21%), vLLM serving ratios,
distillation recovery, the measured baseline training budget (median 1.45x
the pool's compute), the four-way multiple-comparison sensitivity, the
three protocol-sensitivity shortcuts (S1-S3), and the temperature control
on the calibration arm.

Headline: 0 of 92 clean encoder cells improve accuracy over the stronger
single adapter, and 33.7% are significantly worse. 52 of the same 92 improve
ECE — but that comparison is against a single adapter picked by validation
accuracy and never calibrated. On the six pools whose logits cache survives,
fitting one temperature on the held-out `val_combine` split takes the
ensemble from better-calibrated in 4/6 pools to 2/6 (mean ΔECE −0.032). The
ECE gain is confidence shrinkage, and a scalar reproduces it at 1x inference
cost instead of Nx.

Note: a fourth shortcut (contaminated benchmark) and the GSM8K
contamination probe behind it were **retracted on 2026-07-28** — the probe
shifted the reference answer along with the question, forcing near-zero
accuracy on the shifted split regardless of contamination. See the
RETRACTED header in `analysis/gsm8k_contamination_probe.py`.

Each per-cell `analysis/*_cm_*.json` carries explicit `bh_q_value`,
`bh_pass`, `adjudication_pre_fdr`, and `adjudication_post_fdr` fields
written by `scripts/apply_corpus_bh_fdr.py`. The corpus-wide
`bh_batch_hash` pins the cell set the correction was computed over.

### B. Regenerate figures (analysis only, no GPU)

```bash
python3 analysis/plot_protocol_sensitivity.py # Figure 1 (body)
python3 analysis/protocol_sensitivity.py      # S1-S3 shortcut numbers
python3 analysis/temperature_control.py       # recalibration control (title claim)
python3 analysis/correction_sensitivity.py    # four-way correction grid
python3 analysis/baseline_budget_audit.py     # measured baseline GPU-hours
python3 analysis/plot_frontier_scatter.py     # appendix figure
python3 analysis/plot_info_mechanism.py       # appendix figure
python3 analysis/plot_scaling_curves.py       # appendix figure
python3 analysis/plot_verdict_landscape.py    # appendix figure
python3 analysis/plot_two_regime.py           # appendix figure
python3 analysis/cost_savings.py              # Table 12 (cost of blind ensembling)

# Re-fit frontier regression with drop diagnostics + method-onehot ablation
python3 analysis/frontier.py --out analysis/frontier_with_drop_audit.json
```

### C. Cluster reproduction (full training pipeline — requires the original 50-node RTX 3060 cluster)

The orchestration scripts (`experiment_manager.py` / `sweep_runner.py` /
`cluster_controller.py`) target the specific cluster used by the authors and
will not run elsewhere. See "Quick Start" below for the cluster-side commands.

### Scope of reproducibility

- **JSON-level** (guaranteed): every paper number reproducible from released
  JSONs by `scripts/reproduce_paper_numbers.py`. Adjudication labels carry
  explicit corpus-wide BH-FDR provenance (`bh_batch_hash`).
- **Per-adapter logits cache**: retained for 6 of 99 pool manifests, and for
  none of the 23 headline pools. The rest was not preserved. This is why the
  temperature control above covers six pools rather than all of them.
- **Adapter weights**: present for 253 of 1,744 declared adapters (15%) —
  6 pools complete, 22 partial, 71 empty. "Available on request" can be
  honoured for that minority only; the remainder was not retained.
- **Byte-level training replay**: not available for this drop, rather than
  merely deferred. 1,027 of 1,028 result JSONs record `git_dirty=true` and
  every adapter records an unknown `git_sha`, so results cannot be tied back
  to the registered SHA `02a5a6bc` at the byte level.
